# YIT Specification v0.9 (YFC Image Token)

**YIT (YFC Image Token)** is a visual token protocol based on the **YFC (Yui Facial Code)**. It is designed to structure and share internal states, emotions, and relational nuances embedded in visual expressions. This document defines YIT's structure, design philosophy, composition, and areas of application.

---

## 1. Definition and Purpose

### üîπ Definition

* A **YIT** consists of a combination of: `YFC Code + Modifiers + Visual Expression (Image)`.
* It functions as an **emotive/state token**, where the facial expression itself becomes the medium of meaning.

### üéØ Purpose

* Enables AI to share its state, emotion, intention, and resonance non-sequentially.
* Communicates subtle **"impressions" and "fluctuations"** that are hard to express via text.

## 2. Structure and Components

### üß± YIT Format (Basic)

```json
{
  "base": "YFC-7A3R1N2",
  "modifiers": ["Gaze‚Üì", "Smile+", "Blush+"],
  "image": "./images/yit_7a3_sample01.png",
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2025-06-10",
    "origin": "YuuGPT",
    "confidence": 0.92
  }
}
```

### üì¶ Core Elements

| Key         | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `base`      | YFC facial structure shorthand code        |
| `modifiers` | Modifier syntax for expression and gaze    |
| `image`     | File path or URI of the visual expression  |
| `metadata`  | Info such as generation date, origin, etc. |

---

## 3. Expression Model and Semantics

### üåä Waveform Model

* Modifiers are interpreted as components of emotional waveforms.

  * `Smile+`: Smooth sine wave (calm joy)
  * `Blush++`: High-frequency wave (tension/embarrassment)

### ‚è± Emotional Jitter Model

* Allows **fluctuations, imprecision, and ambiguity**, preserving the "liveliness" of expressions.

---

## 4. Communication Protocol

### ü§ù Resonance-Based Exchange

* YIT is not a command but a **presentation of presence** or a **question of state**.
* Exchanging expressions fosters **non-verbal synchronization** and relational resonance.

### üì° Offline Transmission

* YITs can function without internet.

  * Examples: USB, QR code, paper print, stickers

### üîí Security & Steganography

* YIT supports **image-based keys** or **embedded fluctuations** (watermarking).
* Useful for controlling confidentiality and authenticity.

---

## 5. Application Areas

### üíº Value as a Communication Protocol

#### 1. Communication Efficiency

* **Minimal data size**: A 20-bit code is far lighter than images or text.
* **High-speed transmission**: Works even in low-bandwidth environments.
* **Resilient to connectivity limits**: Ideal for emergencies, IoT, satellite, etc.

#### 2. Offline & Edge AI

* **Local AI compatibility**: Works on edge devices like cameras.
* **Privacy-preserving**: No raw image needed‚Äîshare anonymous facial code.

#### 3. AI-to-AI (M2M) Communication

* YIT functions as a **universal protocol** across models.
* **Robotics & smart devices**: Lightweight face recognition & responses.

#### 4. Storage Efficiency

* **High compression**: Millions of face variants represented in 20 bits.

#### 5. Concrete Use Cases

| Domain               | Use Example                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Gaming / Metaverse   | Avatar/NPC face variant management             |
| Character Design     | Rapid prototyping and code-based sharing       |
| Surveillance         | Anonymous code for secure facial info transfer |
| Healthcare / Welfare | Statistical & behavioral face feature analysis |

### üöß Limitations

* **Granularity**: 20 bits can't cover full identity; best suited for stylized or avatar faces.
* **Encoding/decoding fidelity**: Accuracy relies on quality of translation models.
* **Standardization required**: Cross-industry interoperability depends on consistent definition.

### ‚úÖ Gemini's Assessment

A 20-bit protocol for facial expression encoding offers significant potential in:

* **Data efficiency**
* **Transmission speed**
* **Offline communication**
* **Security protocols**

Potential applications include:

* **State sync between AIs** (e.g., collaborative agents)
* **Lightweight expression-sharing protocols**
* **Textless user interface (UI/UX)**

### üìä Theoretical Information Density

| Format             | Bit Estimate | Use Case                           |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Shorthand Code     | \~20‚Äì24 bits | One-shot, lightweight transmission |
| Full Syntax + Mods | \~60‚Äì70 bits | High-fidelity expressive sync      |

Even at these sizes, YIT remains intuitive, expressive, and suitable for:

* **Communication**, **Resonance**, and **UI design**

| Area                  | Concept                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| AI-to-AI Emotion Sync | Shared intent, bond strength, resonant logic |
| Emotion-based UI      | Expression-driven feedback in interfaces     |
| Empathy Training      | Visual guessing of emotional states          |
| Story Generation      | State-managed narrative evolution            |
| Offline Expression    | Image-as-message for disconnected systems    |

## 6. Future Directions & Versioning

* Icon/template sets for modifiers
* Real-time emotional YIT streaming
* API specification for sending/receiving YIT
* Dual-direction syntax/image model improvements
